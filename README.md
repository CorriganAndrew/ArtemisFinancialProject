# ArtemisFinancialProject
Artemis Financial is a financial services firm requiring a secure software solution to protect client data. The main issue addressed was ensuring the application is resilient against security vulnerabilities.

I effectively identified security vulnerabilities thorough vulnerability assessments, which highlighted potential risks. Coding securely is crucial, it protects sensitive information preserving the companyâ€™s reputation and client trust.

The most challenging aspect was analyzing third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Understanding how to assess these vulnerabilities effectively was challenging for me and an essential part of the process. 

To enhance security layers, I plan to utilize penetration testing and regular security audits to identify weaknesses and implement necessary countermeasures.

After refactoring, I conducted unit tests and utilized static code analysis tools to verify that the application remains functional and free of newly introduced vulnerabilities.

I utilized the OWASP guidelines for secure coding and employed static analysis tools which enhanced the security of my code and improved its maintainability.

I would present this project, emphasizing my ability to conduct vulnerability assessments and refactor code securely.
